                                        This layout shows the process of using opendataphilly sources to create a map of areas in Philadelphia that should host a new healthy foods store. Three criteria were involved for determining which areas need a new store: the store had to be within 2000 ft of public transit, further than 
                                        1200 ft from another healthy foods store, and within the Philadelphia Empowerment Zone. First, buffers were created around SEPTA public transit points from multiple shapefiles. Then, each layer was dissolved and the union function was used on these to combine the buffers from seperate layers into one.
                                        This same buffering process was used to find areas meeting the rest of the criteria. Then, the intersect tool was used to find areas where the inclusive buffers have all overlapped.

                                                This layout was created as part of a mastery assignment which encompasses the use of several newly acquired skills from past weeks. In order to create a map of areas in Michigan which are at risk of water toxicity, we used several data tables containing pertinent information on the matter. 
                                        The data tables were joined together through the use of the "join and relate" function of arcGIS. This mastery assignment was also used to practice using buffers and definition query. 2 sets of definition queries were ued to select for location with certain attributes listed on the map. 
                                        Then, buffers were created and dissolved around these points. Finally, the map solely shows locations in Michigan where the 3 requirements were met in one area, so we used the intersect tool to create what is shown through this layout.

                                        When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.
